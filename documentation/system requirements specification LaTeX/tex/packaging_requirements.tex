Include a header paragraph here. Packaging requirements are those requirements that identify how the delivered product will be packaged for delivery to the end-user; or how it will "look" when finished and delivered. For example, you might specify that the software required for operation will be pre-loaded on the hard drive, delivered on CD/DVD, or available via download. Software might be customer installable, or not, etc. Hardware components could be all in a single package, provided as a "bag of parts" to be assembled/installed by the user, painted a certain color, logos affixed, etc. Care should be taken not to duplicate requirements found in other sections of this document.

\subsection{Source code shall not be given to customers immediately}
\subsubsection{Description}
Right off the bat, the source code shall be disputed upon and owned by any number of developers, but it won't be something customers can own immediately.  Customers are simply users of the product, not its owners; however, a single entity customer can purchase the rights to the source code, just like anyone else, so long as it is agreed upon by the current owners.

This section outlines how well the system performs, in which environment it performs best in, thing like open space and low volume areas really benefit the system.  The system will perform required functionality in fair weather with good visibility such as flat terrain. It will accurately detect drones 60\% of the time with a 15\% false positive rate or lower. All functionality will perform consistently on the network without intermittent failures. The system will give approximations on detected drones locations and other factors.

\subsection{System will maintain a false positive rate below 15 percent}
\subsubsection{Description}
When passively detecting drones, the system will not identify incorrectly by pinging the web interface more than 15 percent of the time. False positives will consist of any detection alert that identifies an item in space that is not a drone or drone similar object.

Performance Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Degraded performance due to weather effects may impact performance.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a High priority requirement.

\subsection{System shall verify drones with acoustic detection with a subsystem backup}
\subsubsection{Description}
After detecting a drone utilizing it's primary acoustic system, the system will utilize a secondary detection system to verify it's possible drone detection. When both systems return a positive result, the web interface will be informed of a drone detected.

\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a Critical requirement.

\subsection{The system shall be operable in all times of the day}
\subsubsection{Description}
There will be no regard to day and night. The system will be operable 24 hours according to the power supply provided

\subsection{The system shall not decode or demodulate signals}
\subsubsection{Description}
If a system 'decodes' or 'demodulates' the signal to extract the drone type, serial number, GPS coordinates or the 'Return to Launch' GPS coordinates, it violates U.S. Federal Wiretapping laws. Therefore this system shall be a passive system that uses physical characteristics of the drone example: RF and acoustic

\subsection{The system shall show at least 60 percent accuracy in detection of the drone}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system shall correctly identify the drone 60 percent of the time. This requirement is a subject to change if the accuracy of the system increases.

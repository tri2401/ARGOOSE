This section outlines how well the system performs, in which environment it performs best in, thing like open space and low volume areas really benefit the system.  The system will perform required functionality in fair weather with good visibility such as flat terrain. It will accurately detect drones 60\% of the time with a 15\% false positive rate or lower. All functionality will perform consistently on the network without intermittent failures. The system will give approximations on detected drones locations and other factors.

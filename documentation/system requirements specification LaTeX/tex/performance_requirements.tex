\subsection{Detection of UAV perimeter}
\subsubsection{Description}
The device will detect and track drones flying within 10 meters omnidirectional distance from the device perimeter.
\subsubsection{Source}
Performance Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Since acoustic analysis is a major criteria for drone detection, the system will perform better in open and even environment without any major disturnabnces.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There is no applicable standard for this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
High Priority

\subsection{Detection of UAV method}
\subsubsection{Description}
Because the system uses the physical signature of a sound signal to identify drones, it can detect both known and unidentified drones.
\subsubsection{Source}
Performance Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
A simple drone with identifiable and distinct acoustic signal should be used for testing purpose.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There is no applicable standard for this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
High Priority

\subsection{The system shall show the current location of the device placed}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will track the current location using maps and display it through API.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
There is no realistic constraint for this requirement. Our web app should accurately display the location of the tracking devices placed.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a critical priority for the project.

\subsection{The system shall notify the customer if a drone passes by}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will give a message alert to the customer and the point at which the drone signal was captured if a drone is detected in the radius of the device.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The device should be turned on and ready to process the auditory and RF.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a high level Priority for the project.

\subsection{The system shall show the path in the web application in which the drone travels}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system marks the path on the maps along which the drone passes by in the radius of the device.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The path will only be visible temporarily.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a low level Priority for the project.

\subsection{The system shall categorize the data input from the sensors into potential drones and non drone objects.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will use machine learning concepts for this categorization.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The sensors should be placed in an open area without any significant disturbances.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a critical level Priority for the project.

\subsection{UI Requiremetn}
\subsubsection{Description}
The user will have to register and login to the system in order to use it. The registration system will be delivered to correctly identify the user logs. The passwords shall be encrypted using SSL.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The password will have standard constraints: 7 letters, one capital letter, one small letter, one number and one special character.
\subsubsection{Standards}
Registration username will be email address that will need to be verified
\subsubsection{Priority}

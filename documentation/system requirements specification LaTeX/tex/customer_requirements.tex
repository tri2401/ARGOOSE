\subsection{The system shall show the current location of the device placed}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will track the current location using maps and display it through API.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
There is no realistic constraint for this requirement. Our web app should accurately display the location of the tracking devices placed.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a critical priority for the project.

\subsection{The system shall notify the customer if a drone passes by}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will give a message alert to the customer and the point at which the drone signal was captured if a drone is detected in the radius of the device.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The device should be turned on and ready to process the auditory and RF.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a high level Priority for the project.

\subsection{The system shall show the path in the web application in which the drone travels}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system marks the path on the maps along which the drone passes by in the radius of the device.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The path will only be visible temporarily.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a low level Priority for the project.

\subsection{The system shall categorize the data input from the sensors into potential drones and non drone objects.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The system will use machine learning concepts for this categorization.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The sensors should be placed in an open area without any significant disturbances.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a critical level Priority for the project.

Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Customer requirements are those required features and functions specified for and by the intended audience for this product. This section establishes, clearly and concisely, the "look and feel" of the product, what each potential end-user should expect the product do and/or not do. Each requirement specified in this section is associated with a specific customer need that will be satisfied. In general Customer Requirements are the directly observable features and functions of the product that will be encountered by its users. Requirements specified in this section are created with, and must not be changed without, specific agreement of the intended customer/user/sponsor.

\subsection{System will accept verification of false positives by user}
\subsubsection{Description}
Utilizing the web interface, whenever a positive drone detection has been emitted by the system: The user will be able to manually identify that the drone is not present where detected and inform the system that it is a false positive result. After the system acknowledges this change, it will no longer track the false positive result and store an identifier so that rates of false positives can be assessed by the end user.

Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
There are no realistic constraints to this requirement. Utilizing the web interface to remove detections and storing results should be accomplished without incident.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a priority Low requirement.

\subsection{System will be able to actively track an individual drone}
\subsubsection{Description}
Utilizing the web interface, when the system has positively identified a drone, the user will be able to select that drone. Upon selection, the tracking system will switch to an active tracking mode and attempt to track the selected drone in as close to real time as possible.

Customer Requirement
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Degraded performance due to weather effects may impact performance.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no intrinsic standards to meet this requirement.
\subsubsection{Priority}
This is a Critical requirement.

\subsection{System will detect multiple drones with passive scanning}
\subsubsection{Description}
Utilizing the web interface, the system when not actively tracking an individual drone will passively scan the area. During these scans it will return sweep ping results of potential drones it detects with the acoustic + subsystem algorithm.

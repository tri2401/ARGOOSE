Updates in technologies (hardware or software) should be applied to the system when appropriate.The system maintenance schedule will require product owners to facilitate the code base. Owners are also required to update web applications and design the system such that withstands typical weather effects with it's enclosure. On the customer end, the user will be provided a self analyzing system that will inform them of errors, as well as an expectation of maintenance checks every two years.

\subsection{System will have a self diagnostic bootup sequence}
\subsubsection{Description}
When first activating the system, it will perform an internal, self diagnostic sequence to verify all components are functioning as required. This information will display and assess results on the web interface. Detailing all critical components and if they passed or failed self diagnostic checks.

\subsection{System will withstand typical weather effects without failing}
\subsubsection{Description}
The shell and encasing structure of the equipment will be of such a design that typical weather scenarios, such as rain, will not penetrate and damage or cause short circuit failure of internal components.

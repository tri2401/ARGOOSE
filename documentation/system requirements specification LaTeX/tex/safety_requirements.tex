Detection system conforms to all applicable UTA standards and federal law

\subsection{Laboratory equipment lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures}
\subsubsection{Description}
Any fabrication equipment provided used in the development of the project shall be used in accordance with OSHA standard LOTO procedures. Locks and tags are installed on all equipment items that present use hazards, and ONLY the course instructor or designated teaching assistants may remove a lock. All locks will be immediately replaced once the equipment is no longer in use.

CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Equipment usage, due to lock removal policies, will be limited to availability of the course instructor and designed teaching assistants.
\subsubsection{Standards}
Occupational Safety and Health Standards 1910.147 - The control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout).

\subsection{National Electric Code (NEC) wiring compliance}
\subsubsection{Description}
Any electrical wiring must be completed in compliance with all requirements specified in the National Electric Code. This includes wire runs, insulation, grounding, enclosures, over-current protection, and all other specifications.
\subsubsection{Source}
CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
High voltage power sources, as defined in NFPA 70, will be avoided as much as possible in order to minimize potential hazards.
\subsubsection{Standards}
NFPA 70

\subsection{RIA robotic manipulator safety standards}
\subsubsection{Description}
Robotic manipulators, if used, will either housed in a compliant lockout cell with all required safety interlocks, or certified as a "collaborative" unit from the manufacturer.
\subsubsection{Source}
CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Collaborative robotic manipulators will be preferred over non-collaborative units in order to minimize potential hazards. Sourcing and use of any required safety interlock mechanisms will be the responsibility of the engineering team.
\subsubsection{Standards}
ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems, RIA TR15.606-2016 Collaborative Robots

\subsection{UTA UAV Flying Guidelines}
\subsubsection{Description}
The project has to obey UTA's Guidelines on unmanned aircraft vehicles, so long as we are conducting under the school space.
\subsubsection{Source}
UTA Drone Policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
UTA defines its safe fly zones and outlines its guidelines on how to conduct one's self when flying under UTA's jurisdiction.
\subsubsection{Standards}
CO-CS-PO-07 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Policy
\subsubsection{Priority}
Critical

\subsection{FAA UAV Flying Laws}
\subsubsection{Description}
The project must obey FAA laws involving unmanned aircraft vehicles
\subsubsection{Source}
Federal and State Drone Laws
\subsubsection{Constraints}
FAA descibes who is qualified to pilot, responsibilities of pilots, and pretty much any outlines every guideline on how to handle drones.
\subsubsection{Standards}

In this last section, you will reiterate all requirements that are listed as priority 5. This is repetitive, but necessary as a concise statement of features/functions that were considered/discussed and documented herein, but will NOT be addressed in the prototype version of the product due to constraints of budget, time, skills, technology, feasibility analysis, etc. Use the following format for this section.

\subsection{Third Detection Layer: Computer vision implementation}
\subsubsection{Description}
If time and budget allows for it, detection through visual data stream can add another layer of drone detection verification. Although it seems unviable at the moment, a future implementation would add to the system's functionality.

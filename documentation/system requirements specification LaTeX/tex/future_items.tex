The project will run in two iterations, with the test proof of concept in the first and the end product in the second. The future possibilities with this project would have the following description. 
\subsection{Requirement Name}
\subsubsection{Description}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system shall store the history of drones detected and makes a log of time and the location of when a drone detected for the past week
  \item The system shall display the profile of the user with the option to change email address and change password.This is a User Interface Upgrade where the system will have a profile database which stores the history of drone tracking, gives an option for the user to change their username and password.
  \item The system will consistently detect multiple drones without error.
  \item The system shall send an email for the alert if a drone passes by the perimeter to the security personnel. Alerts are configurable and can also be sent to local law enforcement for a coordinated response.
  \item On top of determining the top-down location of drones, the system would also be able to determine the height of where the drones are
  \item The system will provide real time response to multiple drone intercepts The single real time tracking is expanded to track all detected drones in real time
  \item In addition to the detection layers present the system could have a third detection layer as computer vision implementation. If time and budget allows for it, detection through visual data stream can add another layer of drone detection verification. Although it doesn't seem viable at the moment, a future implementation would add to the system's functionality.

\end{enumerate}

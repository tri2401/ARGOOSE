In this last section, you will reiterate all requirements that are listed as priority 5. This is repetitive, but necessary as a concise statement of features/functions that were considered/discussed and documented herein, but will NOT be addressed in the prototype version of the product due to constraints of budget, time, skills, technology, feasibility analysis, etc. Use the following format for this section.

\subsection{The system shall be able to detect altitude of UAVs}
\subsubsection{Description}
On top of determining the top-down location of drones, the system should also be able to determine the height of where the drones are.  The technique for this has yet to be determined, but the output shall simply be a number and metric displayed somewhere on the user interface (e.g., 70 meters, 120 ft); more than likely, this feature will only be implemented for one drone at a time.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
Altitude calculation will be for drones within a set area (yet to be determined), most definitely within the radius of the main detection system.  It will also be done for one drone at time.

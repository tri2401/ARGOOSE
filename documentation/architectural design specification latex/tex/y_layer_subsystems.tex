In this section, the layer is described in some detail in terms of its specific subsystems. Describe each of the layers and its subsystems in a separate chapter/major subsection of this document. The content of each subsystem description should be similar. Include in this section any special considerations and/or trade-offs considered for the approach you have chosen.

\subsection{Secondary Processing Subsystem}
The secondary processing subsystem is responsible for activation of the secondary sensors and detection system after the object is suspected to be a drone.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
This subsystem assumes that it has an object that is potentially a drone and this information is given by the raspberry pi. 

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The primary responsibility of this subsystem is to confirm that the object is a drone. It activates the secondary detection sensors which sends the signals to ADC and these signals are sent through ODAS algorithm to the raspberry pi.

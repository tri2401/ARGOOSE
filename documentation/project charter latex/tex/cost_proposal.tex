The budget will be \$800 (can increase at the discretion of Professor Mcmurrough).  The money will come from UTA.  At this time our expectation is that the components will require a budget of \$400; this will include things like sensors and micro-controllers.  Our fabrication costs will be estimated at \$200 dollars, and the software takes the remaining budget with \$200.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
Currently our main funding source is from UTA.  There hasn't really been any potential funding sources because this isn't currently a sponsored project.  The current funding source is from the UTA CSE department, at a budget of \$800.

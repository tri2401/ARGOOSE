Our project is to provide a non-militarized, partially DIY surveillance system that identifies and tracks drone activity over a small area, ie. an area that is open to intrusive aerial surveillance. Itâ€™s not necessarily an anti-drone system, but rather one that reports trespassing drone activity. Currently, the design is an embedded system that uses sensorial data to track drone activity and relay that information to the user through a web app interface.

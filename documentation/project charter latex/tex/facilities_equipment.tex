The main lab space that will be utilised is the work lab provided by the senior design course at UTA in ERB 335; it will most likely be our main area of work, especially when tinkering with hardware. In terms of makerspaces, UTA provides that equipment in their library and in Nedderman Hall.  There is no guarantee that we will be using the makerspace equipment, but it's something that we can resort to in order to solve problems or implement features. For testing grounds, UTA has designated safe fly zones; places with high traffic like dorms or the library mall are absolutely prohibited, so we are relegated to the following places:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item The UTA Ballpark (as long as there's no event going on)
    \item The Maverick's Activity Center indoor soccer court (with an appointment)
    \item Inside College Park Center (with an appointment and 107 or greater pilot certification)
    \item The UTA Research Institute (with an appointment)
\end{itemize}
In terms of equipment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item drone (no purchase, UTA provided)
    \item Raspberry Pi (no purchase, internally provided)
    \item TM4C123GH6PMI Microcontroller (no purchase, internally provided)
    \item Respeaker 6-mic Array with ADC (purchase)
    \item PiJuice rechargeable battery (purchase)
\end{itemize}

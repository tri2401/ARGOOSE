Due to the massive and widespread increase in the use of civilian drones in recent years, concerns pertaining to the protection of privacy have gotten more relevant. Our project is to provide a non-militarized, partially DIY surveillance system that identifies and tracks drone activity over a small area, ie. an area that is open to intrusive aerial surveillance. It's not necessarily an anti-drone system, but rather one that reports trespassing drone activity.

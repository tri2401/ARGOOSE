\begin{itemize}
  \item The project will be completed by May 2023
  \item The funding for this project will be provided by UTA and is $800 or more if needed.
  \item A preliminary design detecting an aerial object will be available at the end of fourth sprint cycle.
  \item The installation site should not be crowded and noisy with ambient sounds and noise, the performance of acoustic sensors degrades drastically in such conditions.
  \item The detection range should not exceed 500m thus the sensor will not detect drones in high altitude. 
  \item The detection will be configured specifically to a drone determined by UTA.
\end{itemize}

The Argoose project is one that strives to ensure security in military entities, companies, and every day people.  Drone detection has solutions, but not many of the solutions are universal and compatible with every situation.  Probably the most widely used technique for drone detection is high-resolution radar and that requires a technician for effective use.  The solution that Argoose provides is a readable map interface for anyone to use, on top of cost-effective node sensors to detect drones.  The value that it gives to our sponsor, Christopher Mcmurrough, is the ability to sell the solution to companies and government entities; whether that be in the form of a product or a patent.  The market works off of supply and demand, and with an increase in technological advances in the drone department, the demand for drone detection security systems will only increase, and yet the supply for these systems have remain limited; therefore, boosting the value of our system.
